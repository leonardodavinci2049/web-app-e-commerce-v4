# Task: Implement prompt improvements for Github Copilot

- Based on the context of the current project
- Analyze and implement improvements to the prompt in the `/docs/reference-prompt.md` file

so that Github Copilot (LLM) has more clarity about what I'm asking for and achieves greater success in achieving its objective.
- Don't suggest code structure implementations; just convey the general idea in an organized manner and the necessary information to be displayed.
- Then, save the second version of the prompt in the `/docs/prompt-for-execution.md` file without changing the original base prompt.
